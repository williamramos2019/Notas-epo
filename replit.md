# Overview

This is a full-stack document management system designed to process emails with attachments, extract financial data from documents (PDFs and images), and provide a dashboard for managing financial documents. The system integrates with Microsoft Identity Platform for authentication and uses OCR/PDF parsing to extract key information like names, values, issue dates, and due dates from uploaded documents.

The application features a React frontend with a modern design using shadcn/ui components, an Express.js backend with TypeScript, and PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data persistence. Users can authenticate via Microsoft OAuth, sync emails, upload documents manually, and view extracted financial data through various interfaces including tables, grids, and charts.
